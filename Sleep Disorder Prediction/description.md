![](https://images.onlymyhealth.com/imported/images/2021/December/20_Dec_2021/big_sleep.jpg)  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze lifestyle and medical factors such as age, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, and blood pressure to predict the likelihood and type of sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea. Early detection can enable timely interventions to improve sleep quality and overall health.  

## Dataset Description  
The "Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset" includes 400 individuals with 13 variables covering sleep patterns, daily habits, and health indicators:  


### Key Features  
- **Sleep Metrics:** Sleep duration, quality, and related influencing factors.  
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Physical activity, stress levels, and BMI categories.  
- **Cardiovascular Health:** Blood pressure and heart rate, critical for assessing health risks linked to sleep disorders.  

### Sleep Disorder Categories  
- **None:** No identified sleep disorder.  
- **Insomnia:** Trouble falling or staying asleep.  
- **Sleep Apnea:** Breathing interruptions during sleep, causing disrupted sleep patterns.
